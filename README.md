## About The Repository

This is a project about cleaning a dataset for NYC Trees. We are given a dataset from NYC Trees and we need to clean the data using pandas and all that we have learned so far about Data Cleaning and Data Preprocessing.


### Additional Information

An example dataset  data_100000.csv  has already been downloaded in assets/ folder, which has 100000 rows and is around 21.5MB. The full file is more than 10x larger but it is not required to use the full file. However, please use at least 100000 rows for the final version. Of course, you can always test your code on smaller data sets.

If you want to download a differently sized dataset, you can use the script `download.py` located in assets/ folder. It will create a CSV file similar to `data_100000.csv` in your current directory.

See the usage of the script using

              python download.py -h
              
You will need the sodapy library for downloading the data set.

              pip install sodapy

## Libraries Used For This Project

 **Pandas** https://pypi.org/project/pandas/
  - Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.
  - In this project, pandas is used to clean the dataset


**Typing** https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html
  - Typing defines a standard notation for Python function and variable type annotations.
  - In this project, typing is used to help document the code properly.
