### Mission Objectives
- Be able to use pandas
- Be able to clean a data set

## About The Repository

This is a project about cleaning a dataset for NYC Trees. We are given a dataset from NYC Trees and we need to clean the data using pandas and all that we have learned so far about Data Cleaning and Data Preprocessing.


### Additional Information

An example dataset  data_100000.csv  has already been downloaded in assets/ folder, which has 100000 rows and is around 21.5MB. The full file is more than 10x larger but it is not required to use the full file. However, please use at least 100000 rows for the final version. Of course, you can always test your code on smaller data sets.

If you want to download a differently sized dataset, you can use the script `download.py` located in assets/ folder. It will create a CSV file similar to `data_100000.csv` in your current directory.

See the usage of the script using

              python download.py -h
              
You will need the sodapy library for downloading the data set.

              pip install sodapy

## Repository

**README.md**
  - has all the necessary information regarding the project

**NYC Trees - 1st version.ipynb**
  - This notebook has only the function to clean the data set without explaining all the steps.
  - if you wish to just clean the dataset, you can use this notebook
 
**NYC Trees.ipynb**
  - This notebook has an explanation of the step by step process on cleaning the data. 
  - If you want to know how to clean it step by step, you can use this notebook.

**assets folder**
  - this has 3 files namely:
      1. **README.md**
          - this has all the necessary information regarding the dataset
          - 
      2. **data_100000.csv**
          - this contains 100,000 data in a csv file format

      3. **download.py**
          - this is a python program if you want to download your own dataset
  
**datasets folder**
  - this is where the cleaned datasets are stored

## Libraries Used For This Project

 **Pandas** https://pypi.org/project/pandas/
  - Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.
  - In this project, pandas is used to clean the dataset


**Numpy** https://numpy.org/
  - Numpy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
  - In this project, numpy is used to help clean the dataset.

## Clone/Fork Repository
  - If you wish to clone/fork this repository, you can just click on the repository, then click the Clone/fork button and follow the instructions.

## Pending...
  - There are still a lot of possibilities in cleaning a dataset and adding your own feature, but this will do for now as we dont have a specific model to do yet.
